XML: XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It was designed to store and transport data. It was designed to be both human- and machine-readable.Thatâ€™s why, the design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. The XML file to be parsed in this tutorial is actually a RSS feed.

RSS: RSS(Rich Site Summary, often called Really Simple Syndication) uses a family of standard web feed formats to publish frequently updated informationlike blog entries, news headlines, audio, video. RSS is XML formatted plain text.

The RSS format itself is relatively easy to read both by automated processes and by humans alike. The RSS processed in this tutorial is the RSS feed of top news stories from a popular news website. You can check it out here. Our goal is to process this RSS feed (or XML file) and save it in some other format for future use.
